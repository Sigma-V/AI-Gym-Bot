# AI Gym Assistant

## Description

This Python project using OpenCV builds an AI-powered gym assistant that provides real-time feedback on exercise form, counts repetitions, and offers guidance for various exercises. It currently focuses on bicep curls, with plans to expand to a wider range of exercises in the future.

## Key Features

* Exercise Detection: Leverages computer vision to accurately detect and identify bicep curl exercises from user input. 
* Form Correction: Analyzes user's exercise form using key body joint positions and provides real-time feedback on whether the form is correct or needs improvement.
* Repetition Counting: Tracks the number of completed bicep curl repetitions based on detected movement patterns.
( Scalability: Designed to be adaptable for future integration of more exercises, allowing users to expand their workout routine with AI support.
Installation

## Prerequisites: 
* Ensure you have Python (version 3.x recommended) and pip (package manager) installed on your system. You can verify these by running 'python --version' and 'pip --version' in your terminal.
* Install Required Libraries: Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to your project directory. Run the following command to install the necessary libraries: *pip install opencv-python mediapipe

## Future Development

* Additional Exercises: Implement detection and form analysis for a wider range of exercises, allowing users to customize their workout routine.
* Advanced Form Analysis: Refine form feedback by incorporating more detailed metrics and guidance for various muscle groups.
* Progress Tracking: Integrate functionality to track workout progress over time, providing users with insights and motivation.
* Voice Feedback: Consider incorporating voice output for enhanced user experience.
